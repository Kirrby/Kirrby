## 🎮 Fun Section

Here's a fun little game you can play right here in my README:

```python
import random

def guess_the_number():
    number = random.randint(1, 10)
    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))
    if guess == number:
        print("You guessed it! 🎉")
    else:
        print(f"Oops! The number was {number}. Better luck next time! 😄")

guess_the_number()
